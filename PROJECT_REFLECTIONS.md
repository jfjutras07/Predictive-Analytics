## This document is part of a continuous improvement approach in my Predictive Analytics projects.

For each project in this repository, I include:
  
  - The project name and its completion date
  - A link to the corresponding notebook or repository
  - Two key weaknesses identified in the project that will be addressed in the next one to improve overall quality and analytical rigor.

The purpose is to document my learning progression transparently and ensure that every project directly contributes to developing stronger, more efficient, and more reliable analytical practices.

### Project 1

**Project Name**: IBM Supervised ML Project – Classification

**Month**: Novembre 2025

**Link**: [IBM Supervised ML Project – Classification](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Predictive-Analytics/tree/main/IBM_Supervised_ML_Project_Classification)

**Two weaknesses identified**:

  1-The exploratory analysis could include more insightful and visually engaging visualizations to better communicate relationships between key variables.

  2-The modeling section should provide clearer explanations and justifications for the model choices and implementation decisions, ensuring stronger interpretability and methodological transparency.

### Project 2  

**Project Name**: IBM Unsupervised ML Project

**Month**: November 2025  

**Link**: [IBM Unsupervised ML Project](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Predictive-Analytics/tree/main/IBM_Unsupervised_ML_Project)

**Two weaknesses identified**:

  1-A better understanding of data leakage was gained after project completion: future projects will ensure that all data transformations occur within the training process, preventing leakage before model fitting.
  
  2-In addition to including a summary at the end of each notebook, a section on limitations should be introduced to encourage deeper reflective analysis and improve transparency.
