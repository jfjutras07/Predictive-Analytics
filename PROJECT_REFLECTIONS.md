## This document is part of a continuous improvement approach in my Predictive Analytics projects.

For each project in this repository, I include:
  
  - The project name and its completion date
  - A link to the corresponding notebook or repository
  - One key weakness identified in the project that will be addressed in the next one to improve overall quality and analytical rigor.

The purpose is to document my learning progression transparently and ensure that every project directly contributes to developing stronger, more efficient, and more reliable analytical practices.

### Project 1

**Project Name**: IBM Supervised ML Project – Classification

**Month**: July-August 2025

**Link**: [IBM Supervised ML Project – Classification](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Predictive-Analytics/tree/main/IBM_Supervised_ML_Project_Classification)

**Weakness identified**:

  The exploratory analysis and the last section (actionable insights) could include more visually engaging visualizations to better communicate relationships between key variables.

### Project 2  

**Project Name**: IBM Unsupervised ML Project

**Month**: September 2025  

**Link**: [IBM Unsupervised ML Project](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Predictive-Analytics/tree/main/IBM_Unsupervised_ML_Project)

**Weakness identified**:

  In addition to including a summary at the end of each notebook, a section on limitations should be introduced to encourage deeper reflective analysis and improve transparency.

### Project 3  

**Project Name**: IBM Deep Learning Project

**Month**: October 2025

**Link**: [IBM Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Predictive-Analytics/tree/main/IBM_Deep_Learning_Project)

**Weakness identified**:

The modeling section should provide clearer explanations and justifications for the model choices and implementation decisions, ensuring stronger interpretability and methodological transparency.

### Project 4

**Project Name**: Student Academic Performance & Resilience

**Month**: January 2026

**Link**: [Student Academic Performance & Resilience](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Predictive-Analytics/tree/main/Student%20Performance)

**Weakness identified**:

The pipeline would benefit from deeper automation through a reusable library of generic data transformation functions to improve reproducibility and scalability. In addition, further work is needed to rigorously assess model robustness using appropriate validation tests and diagnostic visualizations, as predictive modeling requires a fundamentally different evaluation approach than purely descriptive statistical analyses.
