# IBM ML Course - Deep Learning Project : Building Energy Efficiency Prediction: Modeling Heating and Cooling Loads

This file contains my final project for the **Deep Learning** module of the **IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate (Coursera)**. The project analyzes the **Energy Efficiency Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** to predict **heating and cooling loads** based on building architectural features.The aim is to provide insights that help municipal decision-makers make better decisions regarding the management of city assets.
