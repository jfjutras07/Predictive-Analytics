The purpose here is to integrate these archetypes into the main dataset and perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis across all features, combining traditional demographic, job-related, and behavioral dimensions.\n\nBy incorporating the previously derived archetypes, we aim to better understand the patterns associated with employee attrition and prepare the dataset for subsequent predictive modeling. The focus of this notebook is on feature exploration, distribution analysis, correlations, and potential relationships between behavioral archetypes and attrition outcomes.\n\n**Author**: J-F Jutras
