## Organization
Each project is contained in its own folder at the root of this repository.

## Technical Stack
Python | R | SQL | scikit-learn | pandas | numpy | matplotlib | seaborn | plotly

## Notes on Project Maturity
This repository serves both as a portfolio and as a continuous development environment. Some projects are intentionally scoped to explore specific modeling approaches, feature engineering strategies, validation techniques, or interpretability methods. Insights and improvements from these projects are progressively consolidated into a shared predictive framework used across more comprehensive end-to-end decision-making projects.
